## About 
Hey there, I'm Tristan! I'm a Computer Science student at York University and an aspiring software engineer. When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me staying active. As a former competitive swimmer, I still hit the pool regularly between classes. I'm also a huge basketball fanâ€”both watching games and playing pickup with friends. Winters are for snowboarding, and whenever possible, I love exploring Toronto's food scene or traveling to new places. Some of my favorite adventures include camping trips across North America's stunning national parks. Lastly and most importantly I love meeting new people! So enough about me, let's connect! I'd love to get to know you.
